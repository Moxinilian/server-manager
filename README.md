# server-manager

Quick Minecraft server manager. 
Includes offsite backup capabilities, auto restart and incident email reports.

## Compatibility

I made this very quickly so it's only compatible with Linux. It's likely your Minecraft server would run on Linux if it requires this level of automated maintenance anyway.
