# server-manager

Quick Minecraft server manager. 
Includes offsite backup capabilities, auto restart and incident email reports.

We have used it in production and are fairly confident it works well, but of course, **this software is provided as-is with no warranty of any kind** (see license).

## Compatibility

I made this very quickly so it's only compatible with Linux. It's likely your Minecraft server would run on Linux if it requires this level of automated maintenance anyway.

## License

MIT License, and any contribution you intentionally merged into this repository will be licensed under the same terms unless stated otherwise.
